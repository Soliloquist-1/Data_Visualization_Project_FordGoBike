# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis and Visualization
## by Mengting Tang


This project is divided into two major parts. 

In the first part, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of FordGoBike. I used Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. 

In the second part, I took my main findings from the exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I created a slide deck that leveraged polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results. 



## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in February 2019.


## Summary of Findings

> In February 2019
> 1. The average trip duration of all bike trips is 704 seconds, roughly 11.7 minutes.
> 2. The majority of users lie between 25 and 40 years old, with male users taking up roughly 3/4.
> 3. Users tend to ride the bikes at 8:00 and 18:00 the most.
> 4. During a day, users tend to ride bikes more often from noon to before midnight.
> 5. Subscribers contribute more trip, while customers generally ride bikes for a longer duration than subscribers do, indicating their respective riding purposes.
> 6. Gender doesn't play much of a role in terms of trip duration.
> 7. Users between 10 to 20 years old ride bikes for longer periods of time, followed by users in their 50s and above.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> From the bivariate and multivariate exploration, subscribers and customers show distinctively different usage patterns which could be tapped into to create customized services. 
> Users in the age groups of 10 to 20 and 50+ tend to ride the bikes for longer durations.
> Male users greatly outnumber female counterparts, but gender doesn't play a significant role in trip duration.
